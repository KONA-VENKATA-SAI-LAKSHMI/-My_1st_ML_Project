Introduction to Business Problem :
===
In this project we will try to give a "NUTRITION RATING" for all the drinks available at 'Starbucks',i call it as "THE STAR RANK"

Background :
===

Taking nutritious food is vey important to our health,it also helps us to be fit.There are many number of beniftis by taking a 'coffee' for instance,Two cups of coffee can cut post-workout muscle pain by up to 48%(From the Journal of Pain, March 2007).

Moreover every time we go out for a meeting some one,we might probably endup at a  coffee shope like Starbucks(mostly in-case of dates).Since Starbucks is the most popular in it's kind we focus on the coffees by it.
                                      
So, we will try to determine the nutrition rank of the coffees.

Target audiences :
===

>__coustomers__ :        Esspecialy those who are in a diet.

>__cooks__ :                 Gives a better scope of evaluating their creation.

>__stake holders__ :     This allows them to set prices according to the nutrition rank.

# Result :

Due high amonut of calories,carbohidrates & iron the _2 labeled_ cluster/coffees are "The most nutrisious" hence, they'll be awarded with __5/5 Star Rank rating.__

Then comes _4 labeled_ cluster/coffees which have heighest amount of protiens & calcium, hence they are awarded with __4/5 Star Rank rating__.

The __3/5 Star Rank rating__ can be give to The _3 labeled_ cluster/coffees which are "rich in calories & sodium ".

The __2/5 Star Rank rating__ can be give to The _1 labeled_ cluster/coffees which have less amount of caffine.

The __1/5 Star Rank rating__ can be give to The _5 labeled_ cluster/coffees which contains least amount of calories & heighest number of caffine.
